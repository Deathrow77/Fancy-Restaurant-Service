Go is a Compiled Language. The original programme was compiled on Ubuntu 18.04. You may need to recompile the source code on your machine by following the given instructions -

1. Clone the repository into your system.
2. Make sure you have the Go environment installed. If yes, open a terminal in the Folder and type `go build src/server.go`
3. This will generate an executable, which can be run using `./server`.
4. The website will be served at `localhost:8000`
